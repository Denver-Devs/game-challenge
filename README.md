# Game Challenge
A little programming challenge.

# Requirements

The game should have at least these:

- character control
- collision detection
- attack/health points

# How should I make it?

This is the fun part! Try to have fun with it is the big thing. It would be fun to 
showcase many different ways to make a game with the three core requirements.

To get you started try one or a combination of these or make up your own:

- Functional
- Object Oriented
- Declarative
- Procedural
- Agile cloud

# What should the game be?
Whatever you want. If you can't decide make an avoidance game like Asteroids or Cube Runner.

# How do I submit a solution?

Make a pull request or file a ticket with the link to your repo with a solution :smile:

_Good luck, have fun!_
